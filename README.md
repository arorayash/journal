# Journal

> Clarisights Journal


A space where our teamâ€™s thoughts and explorations are logged in. We regularly jot down about our projects, product updates, business; breaking down our processes and findings to share them with you.



# Development

We use [prismic](https://prismic.io/) as to host our content so you'd need an API key to pull content from there. Ask someone on the team for it.

Once you have it:

```bash
mv .sample.env .env
# Add the key in the .env file
```

```bash
yarn && yarn dev
```
